# Customer Cohort and Retention Analysis with Power BI

This project utilizes Power BI to perform **Customer Cohort Analysis** and **Customer Retention Analysis** to help businesses understand customer behavior, track retention trends, and optimize strategies for improving customer loyalty. The solution provides interactive visualizations, making it easier to analyze customer data and make informed business decisions.

## Features

The dashboard includes the following key features:

- **Lost Customers**: Identifies customers who have churned and are no longer engaging with the business.
- **New Customers**: Tracks newly acquired customers over a specific period.
- **Resurrected Customers**: Displays customers who have previously churned but returned to the business.
- **Retained/Returning Customers**: Monitors customers who continue to engage with the business over time.
- **Monthly Customer Cohort and Retention**: Breaks down customer cohorts and tracks their retention rates on a monthly basis.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Download Power BI Desktop**: If you havenâ€™t already, install Power BI Desktop from the official website: [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).
2. **Download the .pbit File**: Download the project template file (`Customer Cohort and Retention Analysis.pbit`) to your local system.
3. **Open the File**: Open the .pbit file in Power BI Desktop.
4. **Connect to Your Data Source**: Follow the prompts to connect to your data source (e.g., SQL, Excel, CSV, etc.) containing the customer data.

## How It Works

The analysis is based on customer lifecycle data, typically including:

- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Transaction Date**: The date of each purchase or interaction.
- **Purchase Amount**: The amount spent by the customer.
- **Customer Status**: The status indicating whether a customer is active, churned, or returning.

Power BI will visualize this data to track cohorts based on their first purchase and monitor how they behave over time. It generates key metrics such as retention rate, churn rate, and customer lifetime value (CLV), helping businesses optimize customer retention strategies.
